Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being.And Stephen Hawking, the only thing he has said was ""I do not believe in a personal god"", which would make him a pantheist or deist at best."
